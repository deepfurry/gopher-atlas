# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Pin pnpm 12.3.4 and migrate install policies to the supported workspace settings,
  preserving exact saves, strict engine checks, the existing zero release-age policy,
  and the esbuild/sharp build allowlist without updating application dependencies.
  Update the pnpm setup action for native pnpm 12 support.

- Bootstrap the GopherAtlas platform monorepo with pnpm, Astro Public, React/Vite
  Admin and a loopback-only Go/Fiber v3 CMS shell.
- Add shared Markdown validation, generated OpenAPI client types, disposable
  sqlc/goose validation, design contracts, agent context and initial ADRs.
- Establish pinned dependencies, CI and the repository-wide `make check` gate.
